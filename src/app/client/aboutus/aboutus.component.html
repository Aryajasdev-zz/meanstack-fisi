                <h4>Activities</h4>
                <p>FISI’s activities reflect a commitment to accomplish its objectives. Over the last 40 years FISI has held numerous conferences and seminars to further its objectives. Prominent politicians, academics and ideologists have participated in organised meetings and maintained contact with the organisation including The Indian High Commissioner &deputy High Commissioner, Chairman of the Jewish Community, TUC officials and ethnic press representatives.</p>
                <p>Activities have included a one day seminar at the London School of Economics on the liberalisation of India's Economy in 1992, Enumerous functions and lectures with distinguished visitors from India who have Visited UK such as Shri L.K. Advani, Late Shri Kidar Nath Sahani, Late Shri Dattopant Thengadi, Shri Narendra Modi, Late Shri Ashok singhal, Late Professor Rajendra Singh, Shri Ashok Chowgule & Shri Dr Nagendra.</p>
                <p>We have also hosted charity events to raise funds for humanitarian projects in India. Funds have been raised for education and health programmes; aid families of policemen and soldier who were killed in action; provide artificial limbs through the “Enabled the disabled" project; emergency aid directed towards earthquake and flood relief.</p>
                <p>Having a voice that can be heard at home and on the international stage is important.FISI is active in lobbying various British and European politicians on matters to promote a better appreciation of India‘s position on various issues. A number of press statements have also been circulated on a wide range of subjects. We have expressed opinions from local anti—Indian issues to broader topics including interference by foreign countries in India‘s internal affairs, the human rights record and oppression of Indian people in Pakistan & Bangladesh, and bringing to light the issue of Kashmir as an integral part of India.</p>
                <p>The tendency of the western press to project India and Indians in a tarnished manner has now reduced, but this has only changed after persistent campaigns to correct biased reporting by putting into perspective numerous cases with counteracting facts. To facilitate the broadcasting of these issues, FISI is able to publish literature to distribute for public information as the need arises.</p>
                <p>Part of the role of FISI remains to lobby and act as a pressure group for local UK issues and international relations. FISI continues to be of great importance since it is an impartial organisation that continues to be vocal, particularly on anti-India disputes. We currently have a small dedicated nucleus of members involved in achieving FISI’s aims and are always on the lookout for more volunteers who could assist in our efforts</p>
