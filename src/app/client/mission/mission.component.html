        Valor of Jawans are what legends are made of. But Indian Armed Forces are the lowest paid army in the entire world. The Indian Jawans keep sacrificing their lives to keep the country safe selflessly. Similarly, the Indian farmer has fed the country of billion plus during the most turbulent of the times. However, many farmers are committing suicides. The Friends of India have resolved to mobilize the diaspora to lend a helping hand especially to the families of those who have sacrificed their lives for India, the soldier and the farmer alike.

        Mahatma Gandhi had said that conversion is violence. Billions of dollars are being poured in India to covert the poor and the helpless by fraud. This goes against the grain of freedom of religion. While upholding the constitutional right of propagating the religion and an individualâ€™s right to convert, the Friends of India oppose the fraudulent methods of conversion by use of money-power.

        When India sends a spacecraft to Mars, a leading world daily caricatures it with a poor man in a dhoti with his cow. Media in the West is still under the colonial hangover. It retains the biases and the prejudices that it acquired during the colonial period. Friends of India have resolved to end the media bias against India in world media.
